            Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ I am Rajdeep, an enginer by profession and a programmer by passion.
            I started my programming journey since my school but it got wings recently.
            Having worked as a Research & Development engineer and a Business Analyst for more
            than two years I decided to switch to programming and now I am web developer.
            Currently I'm pusuing Full Stack Development Career Program from <b>Skill Academy</b>
            by Testbook.
            Web Development has provided a plateform to express my skills & creativity and use them to
            create exciting projects.
